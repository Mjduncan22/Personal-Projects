# Overview

This app is a personal daily planner designed to help users schedule, track, and organize their tasks more effectively. As a software engineer focused on improving my Android development skills, I created this app to deepen my understanding of UI/UX design, persistent data storage with Room, and user interaction patterns in modern mobile applications.

The app allows users to:
- Add tasks with a title, date, start/end time, optional notes, and a color label.
- Set recurring tasks on specific days of the week.
- View tasks on a selected day.
- Organize their schedule visually using color-coded entries.

The goal of this app is to create a functional tool that not only reinforces core Android development principles but also provides a meaningful, customizable planning experience.
