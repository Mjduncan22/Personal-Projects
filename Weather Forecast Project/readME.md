# Overview

This project demonstrates the Java programming language by building a console-based weather application that fetches live data from a public API. The software illustrates core Java features including variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and usage of the Java Collection Framework. 

The purpose of this software is to enhance my understanding of Java’s object-oriented design, exception handling, and API integration by working with real-world data. This project also helps me practice using Java’s HTTP client and JSON parsing libraries effectively.
